## Typing stubs for aiofiles

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `aiofiles` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `aiofiles`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/aiofiles. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `8a8db9c6d4e39b4c530b6b6ce03bb6869c394419`.
